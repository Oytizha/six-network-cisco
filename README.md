# Six Network Layout
This project showcases a network layout designed with Cisco Packet Tracer, implementing both RIP (Routing Information Protocol) and Static IP addressing for enhanced network functionality. The layout comprises six interconnected networks, each serving specific purposes within the network infrastructure.

# Features
- Network Design: Explore an intricate network design spanning six distinct networks.
- RIP Protocol: Witness the implementation of the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) for dynamic routing.
- Static IP Addressing: Understand the significance of static IP addressing for specific network segments.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into the following key directories:
- Diagrams: Contains visual representations of the network design.
- Configurations: Provides configuration files for routers and switches.
- Scripts: Includes any scripts or automation used in the project.

# Getting Started
To replicate this network layout, follow these steps:
- Ensure you have Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your system.
- Open the project file in Cisco Packet Tracer to visualize the network layout.
- Refer to the configuration files in the Configurations directory for specific router and switch settings.
